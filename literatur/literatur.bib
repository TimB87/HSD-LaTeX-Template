	abstract = {The glossaries package is very flexible, but this means that it has a lot of options,
and since a user guide is supposed to provide a complete list of all the high-level
user commands, the main user manual is quite big. This can be rather daunting for
beginners, so this document is a brief introduction just to help get you started. If
you find yourself saying, “Yeah, but how can I do...?” then it’s time to move on to
the main user manual (glossaries-user.pdf).
I’ve made some statements in this document that don’t actually tell you the full
truth, but it would clutter the document and cause confusion if I keep writing “ex-
cept when ...” or “but you can also do this, that or the other” or “you can do it this
way but you can also do it that way, but that way may cause complications under
certain circumstances”.},
